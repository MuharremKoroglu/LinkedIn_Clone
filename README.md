## <h2> About This App <img src = "https://c.tenor.com/JsoERRQcZqYAAAAi/thumbs-up-joypixels.gif" width = "42"></h2>
This app is a LinkedIn clone. Shows developers how to use the Firebase system. When the user opens the application, they are greeted with a login screen. A previously registered user can log in. But if not, it must be registered to the application. For registration, a picture, email, username, profession of the user, and password are required from the user. After registration, the user must click on the verification link sent to the e-mail address to log in to the application. After the click process is completed, the mail is verified and the user is ready to log in. If the user forgets his password, he can click the forgot password button and reset his password with the link sent to his e-mail address. After resetting, he can log in with his new password. After logging in, the user is greeted with a TabBar and three screens. On the first page, there is the flow of the shares made by the users. On the second page, a new post is uploaded. The third page contains the information of the currently logged-in user. If the user wants to add a new post to the app, they must add a photo and comment to the post. The photo added by the user is saved in the database with Firebase Storage. Likewise, user profile photos are also saved. Then we save the post to the database using FireStore. The picture used in the post, the comment, the date, the applause, and the profile photo of the user who shared the post are taken. The received information is saved in the database by Firebase. Posts uploaded to the database are pulled from the system to be shown in the flow. We used Firestore objects for this. The received data were saved in the arrays we created. This way, we can get the posts correctly with the indexPath.row in Tableview. For users to like the post, we first obtained the document number given by Firebase. Then we assign it to a hidden Label structure in the post cell. In this way, the user can like the desired post. However, with an algorithm we wrote, the user can only like once. This way, there is a more accurate and understandable number of likes. Finally, we made some fixes for code readability and security.
